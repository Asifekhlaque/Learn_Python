# Learn_Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to emphasize code readability and ease of use, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
# Need of Python
Python is used in a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more.
# Let's Python
# Python Print Statement
print("Hello, GitHub!")
# Operater
An operator is a symbol or keyword used to perform operations on data. Operators are used to manipulate values and variables to produce a result.
# Arithmetic Operators in python
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numeric values.
  # Addition (+): Adds two values together
  result = 5 + 3  # result will be 8
  # Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand
  result = 10 - 4  # result will be 6
  # Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values.
  result = 6 * 7  # result will be 42
  # Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand, and the result is a floating-point number.
  result = 15 / 3  # result will be 5.0
  # Floor division(//):  Divides the left operand by the right operand, and the result is a Not floating-point number.
  result= 5 // 2  # result will be 1 
  # Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division of the left operand by the right operand.
  result = 17 % 5  # result will be 2
  # Exponentiation (**): Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
  result = 2 ** 3  # result will be 8
